# RMIT Policy Assistant Chatbot

## 1. Overview

Welcome to the **RMIT Policy Assistant**! This chatbot helps you find, understand, and comprehend official RMIT policies using a **local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach.

### Key Components

- **Knowledge Base:**  
  Built from RMIT policy documents in Markdown (`.md`) format located in the `<rmit_markdown_content>` folder.

- **Local Embeddings & Search:**  
  Uses [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) to create text embeddings locally and FAISS for efficient similarity search to find relevant policy sections.

- **LLM Generation:**  
  Utilizes **AWS Bedrock** with the Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku model (`anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`) to generate answers based on user questions and the retrieved policy context.

### Project Files

- `build_index.py`:  
  Offline script to process Markdown files and build the local knowledge base index.  
  **Note:** Latest Markdown files are already processed and stored as:  
  `rmit_policies_local.faiss_index` and `rmit_policy_chunks_local.json`

- `app.py`:  
  Main Streamlit web app providing the interactive chat interface.

## 2. Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.11 or above  
- **PIP:** Python package installer  
- **AWS Account & Credentials:** For `app.py` to call AWS Bedrock  
- **AWS Bedrock Access:** For Anthropic Claude 3 model  
- **Cognito User Pool Credentials:**  
  We have already provided in the code
- **RMIT Policy Markdown Documents:**  
  Collection of crawled RMIT policies as `.md` files in `<rmit_markdown_content>`  
- **Internet Connection:**  
  - For the first run of `build_index.py` (to download sentence-transformers model)  
  - For `app.py` to communicate with AWS Bedrock

## 3. Setup Instructions

### Step 3.1: Get Project Files

Ensure you have `app.py` and `build_index.py` scripts.

---

### Step 3.2: Install Python Libraries

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install streamlit boto3 faiss-cpu sentence-transformers numpy PyPDF2 pandas
```

### Step 3.3: Configure AWS Credentials (for app.py)
Update the AWS Cognito and Bedrock configuration in app.py with your credentials:

REGION = "us-east-1"
LLM_MODEL_ID = "anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0"

IDENTITY_POOL_ID = "YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID"
USER_POOL_ID = "YOUR_USER_POOL_ID"
APP_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID"
USERNAME = "YOUR_COGNITO_USERNAME"
PASSWORD = "YOUR_COGNITO_PASSWORD"

Note:
Credentials may already be preset; change if necessary.
build_index.py does not require these AWS credentials.

### Step 3.4: Prepare RMIT Policy Markdown Files
Only required if you have updated or new Markdown files.
Otherwise, skip this step and proceed to Step 4.

Create a folder (e.g., policy_markdowns) in your project directory.

Place all .md policy documents into this folder.

### Step 3.5: Build Local Knowledge Base (Offline Indexing)
Open build_index.py.

Set markdown_dir variable to your Markdown folder path, e.g.:

``` bash
if __name__ == "__main__":
    markdown_dir = "policy_markdowns"
Run the script in your terminal:
```
```bash
python build_index.py
``` 

This will download the embedding model (first run only) and generate:

rmit_policies_local.faiss_index

rmit_policy_chunks_local.json

### Step 3.6: Verify Knowledge Base Files
Make sure rmit_policies_local.faiss_index and rmit_policy_chunks_local.json are in the same directory as app.py.

## 4. Running the RMIT Policy Assistant Chatbot
Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

cd path/to/Assignment3_Chatbot_Python
(Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

### Windows:

``` bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
### macOS/Linux:

``` bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
``` 

Launch the Streamlit app:
``` bash
streamlit run app.py
``` 

Your default web browser should open at http://localhost:8501 with the chatbot UI.

## 5. Features Overview
### Session Management:
Create and select chat sessions; each sessionâ€™s conversation history is saved in a local SQLite database for persistence.

### Local RAG Pipeline:
User queries are embedded locally, relevant policy chunks retrieved via FAISS, then passed with conversation context to AWS Bedrock LLM for answer generation.

### Responsible AI Rules:
The system strictly answers based on retrieved policy content only, refuses out-of-scope questions, filters inappropriate content, and provides disclaimers transparently.

### Chat Interface:
Streamlit chat UI with continuous conversation display and controls to clear history and start new sessions.

### Sidebar Status Panel:
Shows loading status for embedding model and knowledge base, current session ID, and session controls.

## 6. How to Update the Knowledge Base
If you need to update your knowledge base with newer policy documents:
1. Crawl or download updated Markdown .md files into your local folder.
2. Run build_index.py again to re-generate the FAISS index and chunk files.
3. Replace the old .faiss_index and .json files with the new ones in your project directory.
4. Restart the chatbot app to load the new knowledge base.

## 7. Using the Chatbot

Ask Questions:
Enter your queries in the chat input box about RMIT policies.

Contextual Responses:
The assistant uses local policy documents and your chat history to generate accurate, context-aware answers.

Session Control:
Manage chat sessions and conversation history in the sidebar.

Clear History:
Use the sidebar button to clear current session history and start fresh.

## 8. Troubleshooting
StreamlitSetPageConfigMustBeFirstCommandError:
Ensure st.set_page_config() is the very first Streamlit command in app.py.

Knowledge Base Files Missing:
Run build_index.py successfully and confirm output files are in the same directory as app.py.

Markdown Files Not Found in build_index.py:
Verify the path set in markdown_dir and ensure Markdown files exist there.

AWS Authentication Errors:
Check your Cognito credentials and ensure the assigned IAM role has the correct Bedrock invoke permissions.

Embedding Model Loading Errors:
Ensure internet connection during first run and verify the LOCAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME is correct.
